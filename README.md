# Memory Game Project



## Description / How to Play

This is a card matching game created for the Udacity Front End Web Development Nanodegree.
Players are given 16 cards, 8 pairs, and have to guess where the pairs are by clicking on the cards. Score is tracked via number of moves and a star system.
The game also records the amount of time it took players to complete. 

Most of the HTML and CSS file was provided by Udacity.
